  "projectTypes": ["react", "typescript"],
  "rules": [
    "Always use TypeScript strict mode and explicit return types for all functions",
    "Prefer functional components with React hooks over class components",
    "Use named exports instead of default exports for better refactoring",
    "Props interfaces should use PascalCase and end with 'Props' suffix",
    "Custom hooks must start with 'use' prefix (e.g., useAuth, useData)",
    "Avoid prop drilling - use Context API or state management for deep nesting",
    "Use React.memo() for expensive component renders, but measure first",
    "Extract complex logic into custom hooks for reusability",
    "Use TypeScript generics for reusable components",
    "Prefer composition over inheritance for component design"
