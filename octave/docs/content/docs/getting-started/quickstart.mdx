# Quick Start

This guide will help you create your first workspace and start coding with AI assistance.

## 1. Launch Octave

Open Octave from your Applications folder. You'll see the main window with a sidebar.

## 2. Select a Repository

<Callout type="info">
Octave works with Git repositories. Make sure you have a Git repo on your Mac.
</Callout>

1. Click **Select Repository** in the sidebar
2. Navigate to any Git repository
3. Click **Open**

Octave will analyze your repository and show available branches.

## 3. Create Your First Workspace

A workspace is an isolated environment for working on a specific branch.

1. Find a branch in the sidebar (e.g., `main` or `feature/new-feature`)
2. Click the **+** icon next to the branch
3. Octave creates a Git worktree for this branch

**What just happened?**
- Octave created a separate directory for this branch
- You can now work on multiple branches simultaneously
- Each workspace is completely isolated

## 4. Open Files

1. Click on your new workspace in the sidebar
2. Browse files in the file explorer
3. Click any file to open it in the Monaco editor

## 5. Use AI Assistance

Octave integrates Claude Code for AI-powered coding:

1. Select some code in the editor
2. Press `Cmd+K` to open AI chat
3. Ask questions or request code changes
4. Claude will analyze your code and provide suggestions

### Example AI Prompts

Try these:
- "Explain what this function does"
- "Add error handling to this code"
- "Write tests for this component"
- "Refactor this to be more readable"

## 6. Use the Integrated Terminal

Every workspace has its own terminal:

1. Click the **Terminal** tab at the bottom
2. Run commands like `npm install`, `git status`, etc.
3. The terminal is scoped to your workspace directory

## 7. Switch Between Workspaces

The power of Octave is working on multiple branches at once:

1. Create workspaces for `main`, `feature-a`, and `feature-b`
2. Switch between them instantly in the sidebar
3. No more `git checkout` and losing context!

## What's Next?

Now that you've created your first workspace, explore:

- **[Workspace Management](/docs/user-guide/workspaces)** - Learn advanced workspace features
- **[Editor Features](/docs/user-guide/editor)** - Master the Monaco editor
- **[AI Features](/docs/user-guide/ai-assistant)** - Get the most out of Claude integration
- **[Terminal](/docs/user-guide/terminal)** - Use the integrated terminal effectively

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Review a Pull Request

```
1. Create workspace from PR branch
2. Browse changes in editor
3. Use AI to understand complex code
4. Leave feedback
```

### Workflow 2: Work on Multiple Features

```
1. Create workspace for feature-a
2. Create workspace for feature-b
3. Switch between them without git checkout
4. Each maintains its own state
```

### Workflow 3: Test Different Versions

```
1. Create workspace from v1.0 tag
2. Create workspace from v2.0 tag
3. Compare behavior side-by-side
```
