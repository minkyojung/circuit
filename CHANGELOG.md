## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Workspace-Chat Synchronization**: Persistent chat history with SQLite backend
  - Conversation storage with workspace isolation
  - Message persistence across app restarts
  - Automatic conversation/message recovery on workspace switch
  - Database migrations system for schema versioning
- **Block-Based Conversation System Design**: Comprehensive architecture documentation
  - Command Palette (Cmd+K) for unified search specification
  - Timeline View (Cmd+T) with Git integration design
  - Bookmarks system (Cmd+B) specification
  - 8 block types (text, code, command, file, diff, error, diagram, list)
  - Warp Terminal-inspired block-based message storage architecture
- **Chat UI Enhancements**:
  - Glassmorphism design for chat input with floating layout
  - Messages scroll behind chat input with backdrop blur effect
  - Improved visual hierarchy and polish
- Repository management integration with backend IPC handlers
- CloneRepositoryDialog component for Git repository cloning with URL input
- Repository state management in AppSidebar with localStorage persistence
- Workspace filtering by repository
- Automatic native module rebuild for better-sqlite3 via electron-rebuild

### Changed
- **Electron Build System**:
  - Changed TypeScript compilation target to CommonJS for electron files
  - Created isolated module system for dist-electron/ folder
  - Added postinstall script for automatic native module rebuilding
- **Chat Architecture**:
  - Moved conversation handler initialization to app.whenReady() for proper timing
  - Improved error recovery with dynamic conversation creation
  - Enhanced message persistence with optimistic UI updates
- **UI Improvements**:
  - Separated sidebar and chat area scrolling with structural height constraints
  - Fixed layout using h-screen and overflow-hidden on root container
  - Changed SidebarProvider from min-h-svh to h-full for proper layout
- Replaced browser prompt() with custom React dialog for Electron compatibility
- Moved CloneRepositoryDialog outside sidebar for proper z-index stacking
- Removed debug console.log statements throughout the codebase for cleaner production code
- Removed hardcoded paths in TestFixTab and App components
- Fixed TypeScript build errors
- Improved code quality and maintainability

### Fixed
- **Module System Issues**:
  - Resolved "exports is not defined in ES module scope" error
  - Fixed NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch between system Node.js and Electron
  - Fixed better-sqlite3 native module compatibility with Electron 38
- **Conversation System**:
  - Fixed IPC handler registration timing issues
  - Fixed "No handler registered" errors for conversation operations
  - Fixed missing conversationId handling in message send flow
  - Fixed conversation loading on workspace switch
- **UI Issues**:
  - Fixed sidebar scrolling together with chat area
  - Fixed chat messages getting cut off at input boundary
- Fixed prompt() not supported error in Electron renderer process
- Fixed dialog z-index issues by rendering outside sidebar component
- Fixed TypeScript type errors in DeveloperTab (latency handling, useEffect return type)
- Fixed unused import warnings in components
- Fixed window.require type declaration for Electron integration

### Removed
- Deleted unused Sidebar.tsx (replaced by AppSidebar.tsx)
- Removed unused cn import from CloneRepositoryDialog

### Technical Debt
- Consider adding input validation for workspaceId/conversationId (low priority)
- Consider improving error type safety from `error: any` to `error: unknown` (low priority)
- Add unit tests for ConversationStorage and handlers (future)
- Add performance benchmarks for message operations (future)
