  "rules": [
    "Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json (strict: true)",
    "Use explicit types for function parameters and return values",
    "Prefer interfaces for object shapes, types for unions/intersections",
    "Use const assertions and as const for literal types",
    "Avoid any type, use unknown for truly unknown types",
    "Use enums sparingly, prefer string literal unions instead",
    "Leverage utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, Record, etc.)",
    "Use type guards (typeof, instanceof, custom predicates) for type narrowing",
    "Keep types DRY with generics and type inference",
    "Document complex types with JSDoc comments"
